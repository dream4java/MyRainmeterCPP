#MyRainmeter

##What's this?
MyRainmeter is a windows execution program written with c++ and is based on MFC MDI, used to help rainmeter skin makers to design and make the skin easily.

##How to use it?
Well, when the alpha version is produced I will write a tutorial in detail.

##When is it about to publish?
Aha, I don't know either since I am not quite familiar with c++ & MFC. But I would try my best and make each minutes useful.
